The Objective

Today was about setting constraints. We stripped back the gear list to just the essentials. The goal isn't to produce a track, but to define the sound of the project.

I decided to stick to a strict 120 BPM for the first few sketches. It feels rigid, but that's the point. Limitations breed creativity.
